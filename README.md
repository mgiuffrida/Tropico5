# AirCarrierFix

Fixes the Aircraft Carrier's collateral damage logic:
  * Chance to kill civilian should be 50%, not 25%
  * Chance to kill civilian should be 25% with Smart Bombs, not 50%
  * Chance to set fire should be 50%, not 25%
  * Chance to set fire should be 25% with Smart Bombs, not 50%
